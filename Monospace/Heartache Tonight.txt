[Intro]

C  G  G  D  A


[Verse 1]

A                F#m          A                   F#m    
Somebody's gonna hurt someone before the night is through
A                D            A                      E
Somebody's gonna come undone, there's nothing we can do.
A                  F#m             A               F#m   
Everybody wants to touch somebody, if it takes all night.
A                  D                     A                E
Everybody wants to take a little chance, make it come out right.


[Chorus]

        E7         D7                                       A
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.
                   D7                                       B7
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.
        E7
Lord, I know.


[Verse 2]

A                   F#m            A                              F#m    
Some people like to stay out late, some folks can't hold out that long.
    A               D            A                      E
But nobody wants to go home now, there's too much going on.
A                    F#m          A                         F#m   
This night is gonna last forever, last all, last all summer long.
A                    D                A              E
Some time before the sun comes up the radio is gonna play that song.


[Chorus]

        E7         D7                                       A
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.
                   D7                                       B7
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.
        E7
Lord, I know.


[Bridge]

                   A                      A7
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, the moon's shining bright,
   D7                      F7
so turn out the light, and we'll get it right.
                   A                    E7                  A
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know.

A                D            A                      E

        E7
Lord, I know.


[Verse 3]

       A                              A7
We can beat around the bushes, we can get down to the bone,    
       D7                            F7
we can leave it in a parking lot but either way                
                   A                    E7                   A       D
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight, I know.
              A                    E7                   A
There'll be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight, I know.
