# Tutorial

This is Monospace, the **minimal writing and notes replacement** app for Android.

### Monospace keeps things minimal, allowing for basic formatting using its designed-for-touch UI. Simply highlight the text you'd like to format.

* You can keep all your devices in sync by signing in with Dropbox.

* Keep things organised by using Monospace's modern tagging system, simply add tags to the final line of the file, we'll handle the rest.

* Monospace allows you to export in plain text or Markdown, meaning it has copy and paste support with online services such as wordpress.
