# Organising with Hashtags 

Monospace doesn't use the classical folder system you're used to, instead it makes use of hashtags.

When you need to get organised, add hastags to the **final line of the document,** and Monospace will handle the grouping for you.

Hashtags can also be nested too, allowing for a greater degree of organisation.

**Use the '#encrypted' tag to protect important work.**

Check the bottom of this file for some examples.
